On a recent Google stroll, I found an _image_ about a GitHub repository:

{{< figure src="/blog/2021/05/opengraphimages/googlesearch.png" >}}

Neat, where does that come from?

Neat, it's generating them! Of course, there's a [blog post about it](https://github.blog/2019-04-17-custom-open-graph-images-for-repositories/).
And you can preview sites on [https://www.opengraph.xyz/](https://www.opengraph.xyz/url/https:%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fbobbyconti%2FContacts-SwiftUI/):

To be honest: I have been bothered with see my _face_ whenever I share a blog post in Slack:

{{< figure src="/blog/2021/05/opengraphimages/slackpreview.png" >}}

So question: How do I generated them myself?

### Checking out `tcardgen`

A quick googeling later, I found https://github.com/Ladicle/tcardgen

{{< figure src="/blog/2021/05/opengraphimages/tcardgenpreview.png" >}}

```shell
go get github.com/Ladicle/tcardgen
```

A great, downloading half the internet againâ€¦ ðŸ˜…
