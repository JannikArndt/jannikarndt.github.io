Apples Time Machine is a great backup solution, you only have to do _one_ thing: Connect your disk from time to time.

Since that is way harder than it sounds, there's a second option: Buy a [329â‚¬ Time Capsule](https://www.apple.com/de/shop/product/ME177Z/A) and do backups over wifi!

That's too expensive? Here's how to build your own Time Capsule with a Raspberry Pi 3 and an external hard drive.

This guide is based on <https://www.bersling.com/2017/01/02/time-capsule-time-machine-through-raspberry-pi/>, but tries to be more comprehensive and also includes a few workarounds for problems I encountered.

# On the pi

## 1. Connect USB drive to pi

## 2. Find drive

```shell
$ lsblk -o KNAME,TYPE,SIZE,MODEL
KNAME     TYPE   SIZE MODEL
sda       disk 465.8G MK5065GSXF      <= probably that one
mmcblk0   disk  14.9G
mmcblk0p1 part  41.5M
mmcblk0p2 part  14.9G
```

## 3. Format drive

```shell
$ sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda
```

## 4. Install `netatalk`

```shell
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get upgrade
$ sudo apt-get install netatalk
```

## 5. Create a mount point

```shell
$ sudo mkdir /mnt/TimeMachine
```

## 6. Add mount to [file system table (`fstab`)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fstab)

```shell
$ sudo nano /etc/fstab
```

Insert the mount post at the end of the file:
`/dev/sda /mnt/TimeMachine auto defaults 0 2`
and exit with `ctrl + x`, `y`, `enter`.

## 7. Mount device

```shell
$ sudo mount /dev/sda
```

## 8. Make it accessible

```shell
$ sudo chmod 777 /mnt/TimeMachine
```

## 9. Make the drive known to `netatalk`

```shell
$ sudo nano /etc/netatalk/AppleVolumes.default
```

Add `/mnt/TimeMachine "Time Machine" options:tm` at the end, then exit with `ctrl + x`, `y`, `enter`

## 10. Restart `netatalk`

```shell
$ sudo service netatalk restart
```

## 11. Restart the pi

```shell
$ sudo reboot
```

# On the Mac

## 1. Allow unsupported devices

In Terminal, make Time Machine show unsupported devices with

```shell
$ defaults write com.apple.systempreferences TMShowUnsupportedNetworkVolumes 1
```

## 2. Find the remote disk

Open the Finder and click on `raspberrypi` in the network interfaces

Connect as `pi` and your password. Then double click the `Time Machine` disk:

## 3. Add the disk to Time Machine

Head to the Time Machine Preferences and add the new disk:
