# Two-speed IT

## The Problem
You're a corporation. Your IT department is old, slow and can't innovate. Your competitor however can. So you try what every corporation tries: Two-speed IT.

## The solution
It's easy: You take the best employees from every department, put them together, give them the highest priority and a lot of funding. Kind of like a startup, but with corporate money. 

## The catch
You're a corporation. _You don't have good employees._ You drove them away years ago, with your processes and hierarchies. You only have employees who suck less then the others.

## The solution
You hire a bunch of consultants, so your people can tell them to innovate.

## The catch
 You're a corporation, remember? _You don't have good employees._ You have people who are good with processes and hierarchies. They will inevitably build the only thing they know: An old, slow department that can't innovate, with processes, hierarchies _and consultants_. Also, you have deprived your actual IT department of its best employees.
