I left the cold and dark Hamburg winter and escaped to live in Palermo for two months. Here's the story!

# What happened so far

<img src="/blog/2025/03/palermo1_img/hamburg_in_february.jpg" alt="Hamburg in February">

I had to get out of the (way too expensive) apartment, the Hamburg winter was brutally cold and wet again, and I had been to Sicily before, namely Catania last January. I had learned Italian for a year back in Uni, so I was able to at least _read_ and understand most things. 

Other than that, I had no, zero, nil idea what I was getting into. My experience from Catania was, that the Lidl has a rough equivalent of everything I needed to survive, so I searched for an Airbnb apartment close to a Lidl and an Ashtanga yoga studio â€” yay!

It turned out that the yoga studio had moved and the Lidl is a lot like the "Penny on Reeperbahn" â€” a lot of _wild_ characters and yes, condoms at the register. But it is an amazing place in the middle of churches, workshops, construction sites (i.e. one old Italian man with a chainsaw), shops, bars, parks, crying babies, the botanic garden, a few yoga spots and best of all: the Mediterranean Sea.

## First: Move

I had thought deciding on dates and an apartment was hard. But the tough part had only begun: Moving out.

This was only the _first_ batch. We had to come back.

## Back home

For one week, I moved back into _Hotel Mama & Papa_ (5/5 would recommend).

You guessed itâ€¦

In this part of the world, it takes **two hours** to get dark.

But it's a beautiful dark.

## Flight to Palermo

```
07:00 breakfast
08:00 departure
09:20 bag dropped off
09:40 at the gate
11:00 boarding complete â€” with a free seat next to me ðŸ•º
```

Then we had to wait 100 minutes _in the plane_ because the weather in ZÃ¼rich wouldn't have let us land. I would have preferred the gate, but at least I had internet access.

## Welcome, Alien

The worst part of traveling is when you get out of the airport and have to figure out _everything_. Like this machine:

I managed to arrive in Palermo Centrale by train, and my host picked me up from there.

I seem to have some sort of shop-door which directly opens to the ~street~ alley.

I like the bathroom.

The kitchen works. I love gas stoves for vegetables, but I still can't make scrambled eggs properly ðŸ˜¬

My _Vicolo Forno Ai Maestri D'Acqua_ ("Bakery Alley of the Masters of Water" â€” yeah, doesn't explain much, does it?)

I covered my basic needs and went to bed.
