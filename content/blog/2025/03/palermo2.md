The first two weeks of my two months in Palermo are almost over, and I learned a lot.

I make three kinds of pictures:

- **The City** — beautiful impressions
- **Living** — all the weird moments
- **Food** — because it's amazing

# The City

Il Parco delle Salute
- On the left: Porta Felice
- On the right: Mount Pellegrino behind the Mediterranean Sea

The botanical garden is not easy to capture in pictures. It is huge.

There's still some wilderness left

That's where I've found my new favorite spot:

When the sun is shining, I can work from Piazza Magione — with free WiFi from the city

Even on a rainy day, the city is still beautiful

# Living

This woke me up at 8 a.m. every morning:

This is how close the street is to my living room:

This is my toaster

I managed to make "Caffè della Moka"

My street-ie during the day.

A "laundromat" — with two washers and two dryers. 5€/23 minutes
<img src="/blog/2025/03/palermo2_img/laundromat.jpg" alt="What a laundromat in Palermo looks like">

The place you put the trash at night. In Catania (and I believe parts of Palermo), you put a different sort of trash (paper, glass, plastic, organic) in the street (in front of your door) and early in the morning, someone picks it up.
But in Palermo every street has a different "system", and after asking five of my neighbors, someone told me to place everything here. So far, non of it has returned.

# Food

"Just a few veggies" at Salumiera Alcolica (yeah I didn't see the name before) cost me 24€. Learning: Always ask for the price first.

"Salina" has a vegetable platter for 12€ (+3€ for water and 3€ coperto)

Amazing pizza at Bollicine, about 150m from my apartment, for 6€ (+1€ water, 2€ coperto).

Yes, it's served on a plastic plate, with water in a plastic cup, but for 5€ (+1€ water, no coperto), this was the best veggie sandwich I've had so far, at "Al Corso"

The best breakfast is still the one at home
